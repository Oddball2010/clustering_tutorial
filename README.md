# Geochemical Facies Analysis

This is the repo for the article, *Geochemical Facies Analysis using Unsupervised Machine Learning*, that appeared in the January 2018 CSEG Recorder, focused on Machine Learning.

This tutorial demonstrates how dimensionality reduction and unsupervised machine learning can be used to analyze X-ray fluorescence measurements of cuttings samples. 

The [notebook](https://github.com/brendonhall/clustering_tutorial/blob/master/Geochemical%20Facies%20Analysis.ipynb) contains the article and the full code used to generate the results.
